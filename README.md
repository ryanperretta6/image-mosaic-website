Final project for CS-554 Fall 2021

How to run the App:

We have two parts that need to be started for our application:

1. Mosiac Server:
  Before you can run the server you need to install a few python packages for it to work
    Packages:
     -  Flask
     -  boto3
     -  botocore
     -  pymongo
     -  uuid
     -  flask_cors
     -  PIL
     -  scipy
     -  numpy
     -  shutil
     
  After you dowload those packages, run with server from the flask server folder with the command line prompt 'python server.py'
  
  NOTE: Server runs on port 5000 as a heads up

2. React 
  That is pretty simple, from the react folder just run npm start
  Once server is ready, you need to sign-up/login to submit and image and create a mosiac.
  
  ENJOY!
